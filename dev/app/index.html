            I would build this TODO app in PHP and use a MySQL database. The front-end would use HTML, CSS, and Javascript. I would use the jQuery library. For testing I could use Selenium, and for deployment I could use Jenkins for PHP. First I would set up the database structure. The 'task' table would contain columns representing 'task id', 'task name', 'task list id', and 'status'. The 'task list' table would contain 'task list id', and 'task list name'. I would generate the webpage in html and css. The '+ new task list' and the '+ new Task' would use javascript/jquery calls that would automatically populate the task list items on the left and the individual tasks on the right. this could use AJAX so that the screen does not need to be refreshed. Also, the '+ new task list' and the '+ new Task' would use PHP and sql commands to create a new column value either in the 'task' table or the 'task list' table depending on what was pressed. To associate a 'task' with a 'task list', a popup could show that would allow the user to select what 'task list' the 'task' belongs to, or to create a new task list. After tasks have been created, When the tasks on the right are clicked on, the 'status' of the task is set to 'complete' or 'incomplete', and depending on the status, the values would have the strikethrough or the 'complete' text on the right. To test that all the click events work you can use Selenium to simulate the browser actions. To deploy to a server you can use Jenkins for PHP.
